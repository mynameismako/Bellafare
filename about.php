    <p>For over the past decade, Kristin has had the privilege to plan and design hundreds of weddings and events throughout the country. Her love for all things design and style initially led her to the event industry; where she feels attention to detail and creativity are of the utmost importance. Her career began in New York City, where she lived for nine years, interning and assisting some of the top weddings planners in the country. After quickly realizing she couldn’t keep her innate entrepreneurial spirit at bay, she launched Bellafare; offering luxury planning and design services throughout the country. She feels it is truly an honor to work with couples to bring their vision to life on their most important day. Drawn to all things organic, modern, and elegant; Kristin approaches each event with her signature style and creativity.
      </p>
      <br>
    <p>When Kristin is not following her passions, she enjoys spending time with her husband Drew, daughter Emerson, and son Gray at their home in Charleston, SC.</p>
